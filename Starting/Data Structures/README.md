# Python Data Structures

* List
    *   Have no fixed size (fixed size, also known as static array that means same type are stored in contiguous memory locations with a predetermined size that remains constant throughout the program's execution.) [link](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-fixed-size-array).
    *   Ordered.
    *   Mutable.
    *   Supports sequance operations (L * 2 = [...]).

* Tuple

    *   Is roughly like string that cannot be changed.
    *   Immutable.
    *   Sequance as lists.

* Set

    *   Unordered.
    *   Unique and immutable objects that supports operations math. set theory.
    *   Iterable.

*   Dictionaries
